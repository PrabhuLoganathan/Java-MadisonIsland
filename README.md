#This is a simple project I created using Selenium Webdriver, Maven, Java and the testing framework TestNG. 
 For this project, I have implemented the widely used selenium Webdriver framework PageObject design pattern with PageFactory. 
 
 I am currently working on making this project run on multiple threads and run across multiple browser,
 including the headless browser known as phantomJS.
